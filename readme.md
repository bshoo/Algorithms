# Algorithms
### This repository contains some of the algorithms that have been implemented by me and were part of the Algorithms course.

- There are implementations of some sorting algorithms, tree traversals(Breadth First, Depth First.)
- Some classic algorithms for creating MST(Minimum Spanning Tree.) 
- Among Other things.
